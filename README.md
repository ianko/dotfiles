# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles to be used with
[Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/ianko/mac-dev-playbook),
which configures a Mac from scratch using Ansible, and incorporates the
installation and updating with these dotfiles.

This was forked and/or inspired by the previous work of others like @geerlingguy,
@paulirish and @mathiasbynens.
